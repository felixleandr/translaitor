# TranslAItor

TranslAItor is an web-based app that use Google Translate and OpenAI as it's main feature, which we can get the translation from the input word, and OpenAI will give a short explanation from the word.
There are times when I went to Google Translate to find out the meaning of a word I don't know, but Google translate only provide the translation, so I make use of the OpenAI to provide the short explanation, so not only we get the translation, but also the meaning and explanation of the word.

Apart from translating, you can also save the word into your history, like a word cards.
